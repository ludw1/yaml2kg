This script converts yaml files to a knowledge graph html. It utilizes the storage of the documentation in a context-aware data format seen in [this json file](json/rest_lessvariables.json).
## Usage
After installing the required python packages using ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` calling the script with the specified yaml file will produce a html file in the output directory which can also be specified using the -o flag.
